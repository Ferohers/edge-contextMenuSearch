# edge-contextMenuSearch
This is an extension for Microsoft Edge browser. Extension adds context menu item when there is selected text on the page and provides an ability to search this text with search engine.
You can choose from 3 default search engines. Or add your own url and use it. (See options page.)

For now that's all. But while Edge lacks the search via right-click I hope it helps.

For feature request create an issue and it will be reviewed and processed ;)
